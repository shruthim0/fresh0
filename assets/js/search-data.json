            "content": "Objectives . Understand how computers can be used to represent real-world phenomena or outcomes | Compare simulations with real-world contexts. | Implement code to mimic real world situations, problems, or phenomena. | What are simulations? . Take notes on vocabulary terms and concepts! . Simulations are abstractions that mimic more complex objects or phenomena from the real world Purposes include drawing inferences without the contraints of the real world | . | Simulations use varying sets of values to reflect the changing state of a real phenomenon | Often, when developing a simulation, it is necessary to remove specific details or simplify aspects Simulations can often contain bias based on which details or real-world elements were included/excluded | . | Simulations allow the formulation of hypotheses under consideration | Variability and randomness of the world is considered using random number generators | Examples: rolling dice, spinners, molecular models, analyze chemicals/reactions... | . Analyzing an Example: Air-Traffic Simulator . Say we want to find out what the optimal number of aircrafts that can be in the air in one area is. . A simulation allows us to explore this question without real world contraints of money, time, safety Unfortunately we can&#39;t just fly 67 planes all at once and see what happens | . | Since the simulation won&#39;t be able to take all variables into control, it may have a bias towards one answer | Will not always have the same result | . Funtions/programs needed often when creating simulations . import random # a module that defines a series of functions for generating or manipulating random integers random.choice() #returns a randomly selected element from the specified sequence random.choice(mylist) # returns random value from list random.randint(0,10) #randomly selects an integer from given range; range in this case is from 0 to 10 random.random() #will generate a random float between 0.0 to 1. . Try using these functions! . trying out functions Randomly select select a number from 1-100, assign it to be x, and print it if you have time, add a user input box ! | . | . | Use the template and create a function that will choose one thing from a list of clothes to throw out Bonus: Add user input. User can deciede whether they want to &quot;add&quot; clothes to their closet, or &quot;trash&quot; something from their closet. If they chose &quot;add,&quot; then from a new list of clothes, randomly select one piece to append to myclothes. If they chose &quot;trash&quot; select one item from &quot;myclothes&quot; to throw out. | . | . def mycloset(): myclothes = [&quot;red shoes&quot;, &quot;green pants&quot;, &quot;tie&quot;, &quot;belt&quot;] . Check-in . With your teams discuss what could be the answer for the question below. Once you think you have the right answer, raise your hand and explain why you think the answer you have chosen is correct. If you get the correct answer, you get a reward :) . Question: The following code simulates the feeding of 4 fish in an aquarium while the owner is on a 5-day trip: . numFish ← 4 . foodPerDay ← 20 . foodLeft ← 160 . daysStarving ← 0 . REPEAT 5 TIMES { . foodConsumed ← numFish * foodPerDay foodLeft ← foodLeft - foodConsumed IF (foodLeft &lt; 0) { daysStarving ← daysStarving + 1 } . } . Why is this simulation considered an abstraction? . 1: It uses a conditional to execute one part of the code only when a particular condition is met. | 2: It uses a REPEAT loop to run the same block of code multiple times. | 3: It simplifies a real-world scenario into something that can be modeled in code and executed on a computer. | 4: It does not request input from the user or display output to the user. | . Let&#39;s look at an example: Coin Flip . import random def coinflip(): #def function randomflip = random.randint(0, 1) #picks either 0 or 1 randomly (50/50 chance of either) if randomflip == 0: #assigning 0 to be heads--&gt; if 0 is chosen then it will print, &quot;Heads&quot; print(&quot;Heads&quot;) else: if randomflip == 1: #assigning 1 to be tails--&gt; if 1 is chosen then it will print, &quot;Tails&quot; print(&quot;Tails&quot;) #Tossing the coin 5 times: t1 = coinflip() t2 = coinflip() t3 = coinflip() t4 = coinflip() t5 = coinflip() . Heads Heads Heads Tails Heads . Activity: Change the code below so that instead of using a fair coin, a weighted coin is flipped. THis means there is no longer an equal chance that either heads of tails will be flipped. Let&#39;s say there is a 2/3 chance of heads and only 1/3 chance of tails. . Hint: maybe you can increase the range of integers? . . Using Binary for Simulations . jiya . . Explanation of ^^ . Hacks . Shruthi, Noor, Ananya . Hack #1: Create an algorithm that will flip a dice . Hack #2: Using the questions bank below, create a quiz that presents the user a random question and calculates the user&#39;s score. You can use the template below or make your own. Making your own using a loop can give you extra point. . questions = 4 correct = 0 Q1 = input() if Q1 == : Q2 = input() if Q2 == : Q3 = input() if Q3 == : Q4 = input() print( &quot; you scored &quot; + str(correct) +&quot;/&quot; + str(questions)) . Hack #3: Create your own simulation based on a randomized real-world scenario. What would you want to simulate? (cannot be the coins, dice, closet or other previous examples) .",

A researcher gathers data about the effect of Advanced Placement®︎ classes on students&#39; success in college and career, and develops a simulation to show how a sequence of AP classes affect a hypothetical student&#39;s pathway.Several school administrators are concerned that the simulation contains bias favoring high-income students, however. answer options: The simulation is an abstraction and therefore cannot contain any bias | The simulation may accidentally contain bias due to the exclusion of details. | If the simulation is found to contain bias, then it is not possible to remove the bias from the simulation. | The only way for the simulation to be biased is if the researcher intentionally used data that favored their desired output. | | . | Jack is trying to plan his financial future using an online tool. The tool starts off by asking him to input details about his current finances and career. It then lets him choose different future scenarios, such as having children. For each scenario chosen, the tool does some calculations and outputs his projected savings at the ages of 35, 45, and 55.Would that be considered a simulation and why? answer options No, it&#39;s not a simulation because it does not include a visualization of the results. | No, it&#39;s not a simulation because it does not include all the details of his life history and the future financial environment. | Yes, it&#39;s a simulation because it runs on a computer and includes both user input and computed output. | Yes, it&#39;s a simulation because it is an abstraction of a real world scenario that enables the drawing of inferences. | | . | Sylvia is an industrial engineer working for a sporting goods company. She is developing a baseball bat that can hit balls with higher accuracy and asks their software engineering team to develop a simulation to verify the design.Which of the following details is most important to include in this simulation? answer options Realistic sound effects based on the material of the baseball bat and the velocity of the hit | A depiction of an audience in the stands with lifelike behavior in response to hit accuracy | Accurate accounting for the effects of wind conditions on the movement of the ball | A baseball field that is textured to differentiate between the grass and the dirt | | . | Ashlynn is an industrial engineer who is trying to design a safer parachute. She creates a computer simulation of the parachute opening at different heights and in different environmental conditions.What are advantages of running the simulation versus an actual experiment? answer options The simulation will not contain any bias that favors one body type over another, while an experiment will be biased. | The simulation can be run more safely than an actual experiment | The simulation will accurately predict the parachute&#39;s safety level, while an experiment may be inaccurate due to faulty experimental design. | The simulation can test the parachute design in a wide range of environmental conditions that may be difficult to reliably reproduce in an experiment. | | this question has 2 correct answers | . | YOUR OWN QUESTION; can be situational, pseudo code based, or vocab/concept based | YOUR OWN QUESTION; can be situational, pseudo code based, or vocab/concept based | questions = 6 correct = 0 Q1 = input() if Q1 == : Q2 = input() if Q2 == : Q3 = input() if Q3 == : Q4 = input() print( &quot; you scored &quot; + str(correct) +&quot;/&quot; + str(questions)) .
